# Bobble AIAssignment
About the assignment:-
The assignment had two problem statements,and both of the problems were related to trie data structure which are following-
 
1. FIND THE WORD-
In this problem we have given a dictionary and frequency of each word as input.we have to find word in the dictionary and if the word is present print "YES" otherwise "NO".
in this we will use trie data structure inorder to solve the problem.

2.REVERSE SEARCH:-
In this problem a dictionary of words is given with all the words indexed from 0 to N,and store these words in a trie data structure so that a search operation can be performed on the index which will return the actual word itself.

# To run the code:-
step 1: Clone the repository.
step 2: make sure g++ is installed in the system and all the enviorment variable is set inorder to avoid any system error.
step 3: with the help of the cmd.
step 4: type g++ findword.cpp
step 5: type g++ reversesearch.cpp
step 6: type .\a.exe.
